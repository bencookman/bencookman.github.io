### Myself
Hiya -- I'm Ben, a Mathematician from [Northampton](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZQo4n8aG5CiH53bo9), an often disregarded commuter town in the centre of the England. Welcome to my website! I plan on posting as often as I have time for to share some tid-bits from my research alongside general ramblings on things I find interesting.

### Current Position
Currently, I'm a PhD student at the [University of Manchester](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/benjamin-levi-cookman), with a PhD title of 'Combustion Instabilities in Porous Media'. This is a fairly dense name, so rest assured that it really just means I study flames in various environments. I've only just started this though, so I don't yet have much to write about on the subject.

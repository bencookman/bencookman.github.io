### Myself
Hiya -- I'm Ben, a Mathematician from [Northampton](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZQo4n8aG5CiH53bo9), an often disregarded commuter town in the centre of the England.

Welcome to my website! I plan on posting as often as I have time for to share some tid-bits from my research alongside general ramblings on things I find interesting.

### Current Position
Currently, I'm a PhD student at the [University of Manchester](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/benjamin-levi-cookman), with a PhD title of 'Combustion Instabilities in Porous Media'. This is a fairly dense name but really means I research various stability conditions of flames, especially those in complex environments.

That said, I only started in January so I'm pretty new to the subject. In time I'll get around to writing a blog post on the topic, why I chose it and what it means in more detail. Eventually this should lead to novel findings, although that's a long way off yet!
